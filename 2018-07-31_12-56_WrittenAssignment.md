information on service x
when will it be ready
can I change some things

Hi Sven, I would like to ask you a few questions regarding GI web API. First, was there any decisions for how the bulk api will be implemented, meaning is there gonne be a pusn mechanism for callback or the client will pull a specific url? Will there be a Queue for messaging? 

Conserning deployment, what are the steps for development environment? 

From what I understand, you are still developping some features on GI service. Can I assume that the API will not change? And when will the service be production ready?

And lastly, can I push some modifications into GI service or that would disrupt you current work?

thanks 

Jean Michel
